This project is the programming assignment of the class ICS(Introduction to Computer System)
in Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University.

For the guide of this programming assignment,
refer to http://nju-ics.gitbooks.io/ics2020-programming-assignment/content/


The following subprojects/components are included. Some of them are not fully implemented.
* [NEMU](https://github.com/NJU-ProjectN/nemu)
* [Abstract-Machine](https://github.com/NJU-ProjectN/abstract-machine)
* [Nanos-lite](https://github.com/NJU-ProjectN/nanos-lite)
* [Navy-apps](https://github.com/NJU-ProjectN/navy-apps)

This is my exercise for learning CS. It's updated IN PA1~PA3. PA4~PA5 is for coding os that maybe updated when I have some times after.

Maybe some codes not really right. But for learning CS, it's just enough for office worker, I think.
